Let's make everything SEO optimal! The purpose of this is to find the weak code and make it stronger for SEO purposes. It's called refactoring! I'm motivated to do this so I can learn the process of coding and learn how to properly debug code. I want to become a front end web developer. I learned that you need to have determination and perseverance to overcome the obstacles of coding! The prework embraced having that mindset, knowing you will stumble.

The HTML required a lot of refactoring. The header was missing a title. The heading was misspelled within the body. I refactored so all links scroll, the Search Engine Optimization link was broken. I updated the HTML within the Benefits class. I replaced div with article. I added alt attributes to images. I altered heading text and added a h3. I provided structure for each benefit section with an article element. Lastly for the HTML, I refactored the footer by adding descriptive class names.

For the CSS, many of the redundant classes with the same formatting could be grouped together as one class. I had to updated the HTML accordingly.
